echo "   - website_url → website"
echo "   - notes → notes"
echo "   - source → source"
echo "   - source_metadata → sourceMetadata"
echo "   - created_at → createdAt"
echo "   - updated_at → updatedAt"

echo "🔧 Next Steps:"
echo "   1. Check server logs for actual field names"
echo "   2. Update database field names to match iOS expectations"
echo "   3. Or update iOS CodingKeys to match database field names"
echo "   4. Test field mapping with actual data"
