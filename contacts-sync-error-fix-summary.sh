echo "üîß CONTACTS SYNC ERROR FIX SUMMARY"
echo "==================================="

echo ""
echo "‚ùå Original Problem:"
echo "   - JSON Decode Error: 'Unexpected end of file'"
echo "   - Contacts API returning empty response"
echo "   - Sync process failing completely"
echo "   - App crashing on startup"

echo ""
echo "üîç Root Cause Analysis:"
echo "   - Contacts API endpoint returns 200 but empty data"
echo "   - APIClient tries to decode empty data as JSON"
echo "   - This causes 'Unexpected end of file' error"
echo "   - Sync process fails and crashes the app"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Fixes Applied:"
echo "   1. APIClient.swift:"
echo "      - Added empty response detection"
echo "      - Return default empty array for [Contact] types"
echo "      - Prevent JSON decode errors on empty responses"
echo ""
echo "   2. ContactsAPIClient.swift:"
echo "      - Added try-catch around API calls"
echo "      - Return empty array instead of throwing errors"
echo "      - Prevent sync from failing completely"
echo ""
echo "   3. SyncManager.swift:"
echo "      - Added try-catch around contacts sync"
echo "      - Log warnings but don't fail entire sync"
echo "      - Allow business cards to sync normally"

echo ""
echo "üéØ Expected Results:"
echo "   - App starts successfully ‚úÖ"
echo "   - Business cards sync normally ‚úÖ"
echo "   - Contacts sync shows warning but continues ‚úÖ"
echo "   - No more JSON decode errors ‚úÖ"
echo "   - User can still use the app ‚úÖ"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ Test Instructions:"
echo "   1. Run the iOS app"
echo "   2. Check Xcode console logs"
echo "   3. Should see warning messages but no crashes"
echo "   4. Business cards should sync normally"
echo "   5. Contacts tab should be empty but functional"

echo ""
echo "üí° Next Steps:"
echo "   1. Test the app to confirm fix works"
echo "   2. Debug server-side contacts API separately"
echo "   3. Once server is fixed, contacts will sync automatically"
echo "   4. No more app crashes due to API issues"

echo ""
echo "üîß Technical Details:"
echo "   - Empty response handling in APIClient"
echo "   - Graceful error handling in ContactsAPIClient"
echo "   - Non-blocking sync process in SyncManager"
echo "   - Maintains app stability while debugging server issues"
