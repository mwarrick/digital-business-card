echo "âœ… RATE LIMIT BYPASS IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY"
echo "============================================="

echo ""
echo "ðŸ”§ What Was Added:"
echo "   1. IP Address Bypass: 76.175.179.85"
echo "   2. Comprehensive IP Detection:"
echo "      - HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP (Cloudflare)"
echo "      - HTTP_CLIENT_IP (Proxy)"
echo "      - HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR (Load balancer)"
echo "      - HTTP_X_FORWARDED (Proxy)"
echo "      - HTTP_X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP (Cluster)"
echo "      - HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR (Proxy)"
echo "      - HTTP_FORWARDED (Proxy)"
echo "      - HTTP_X_REAL_IP (Nginx proxy)"
echo "      - REMOTE_ADDR (Standard)"
echo "   3. Logging: Server logs bypassed requests"
echo "   4. Multiple IP Support: Handles forwarded IPs"

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:"
echo "   1. API receives request"
echo "   2. Detects your IP address (76.175.179.85)"
echo "   3. Checks if IP is in bypass list"
echo "   4. If match: Skips rate limiting entirely"
echo "   5. If no match: Applies normal rate limiting"

echo ""
echo "âœ… Test Results:"
echo "   - Multiple API calls: All successful"
echo "   - No rate limit errors: Confirmed"
echo "   - Contacts API: Working perfectly"
echo "   - Cards API: Working (auth errors expected)"

echo ""
echo "ðŸš€ Benefits:"
echo "   - No more 'too many requests' errors"
echo "   - Unlimited API calls from your IP"
echo "   - Other users still have rate limiting"
echo "   - Development/testing is unrestricted"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ’¡ Additional IPs:"
echo "   - To add more IPs, edit the bypassIPs array in Api.php"
echo "   - Format: ['76.175.179.85', '192.168.1.100', '10.0.0.1']"
echo "   - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses"

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ‰ Rate limiting bypass is now active for your IP address!"
echo "   You can make unlimited API calls without restrictions."
