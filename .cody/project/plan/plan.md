## Overview
This implementation plan covers the development of an open-source digital business card system consisting of an iOS SwiftUI application, a web interface, and a PHP/MySQL backend API. The system enables users to create, manage, and share digital business cards via QR codes at networking events, with real-time synchronization between mobile and web platforms.

## Architecture
**Three-tier architecture with cross-platform synchronization:**

- **Frontend Tier**: iOS SwiftUI app and responsive web application (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **API Tier**: RESTful PHP 8.1+ backend with Apache 2.4+ web server
- **Data Tier**: MySQL 8+ database with secure credential management

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Email-only authentication with verification codes (no password storage)
- RESTful API design for cross-platform compatibility
- Secure API architecture protecting database credentials from mobile clients
- Real-time synchronization using API polling/push mechanisms
- QR code generation for easy contact sharing

## Components
- **iOS Application**: SwiftUI-based mobile app for business card creation and QR code sharing
- **Web Application**: Browser-based interface with enhanced functionality beyond mobile capabilities
- **Authentication Service**: Email verification and session management system
- **Business Card Management**: CRUD operations for contact information and media assets
- **QR Code Generator**: Service for creating shareable QR codes linking to user profiles
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for data synchronization between platforms
- **Database Layer**: MySQL database with user, business card, and session management
- **File Storage**: Media asset management for profile photos, company logos, and cover graphics

## Data Model
- **Users**: Email, verification status, session tokens, creation timestamps
- **Business Cards**: User ID, personal information (name, phone, email), company details, bio, media assets
- **Contact Information**: Multiple email addresses and phone numbers with type classifications
- **Media Assets**: Profile photos, company logos, cover graphics with metadata
- **Sessions**: User authentication tokens, expiration times, device information
- **QR Codes**: Generated codes linking to user business card profiles

## Major Technical Steps
- **Backend API Development**: Create RESTful endpoints for user management, business card CRUD, and authentication
- **Database Schema Design**: Implement MySQL tables for users, business cards, sessions, and media assets
- **Authentication System**: Build email verification and session management with secure token handling using Google Gmail API
- **iOS App Development**: Create SwiftUI interface for business card creation, editing, and QR code display
- **Web Application**: Develop responsive web interface with enhanced business card management features
- **QR Code Integration**: Implement QR code generation and scanning functionality
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Establish real-time data synchronization between mobile and web platforms
- **Security Implementation**: Secure API endpoints and protect database credentials from mobile clients
- **Media Management**: File upload, storage, and optimization for profile photos and company assets
- **Testing & Documentation**: Comprehensive testing suite and open-source documentation

## Tools & Services
- **Development Environment**: Xcode for iOS development, PHP development environment
- **Database**: MySQL 8+ with phpMyAdmin or similar management tool
- **Web Server**: Apache 2.4+ with PHP 8.1+ support
- **QR Code Library**: PHP QR code generation library and iOS QR code scanning framework
- **Email Service**: Google Gmail API for verification code delivery and SMTP functionality
- **File Storage**: Local file system or cloud storage for media assets
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management and open-source distribution
- **API Testing**: Postman or similar tool for API endpoint testing
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based documentation system for open-source community

## Risks & Unknowns
- **Cross-Platform Sync Complexity**: Ensuring consistent data synchronization between iOS and web platforms
- **Email Delivery Reliability**: Dependence on Google Gmail API for authentication verification and potential API rate limits
- **QR Code Scanning Compatibility**: Ensuring QR codes work across different mobile devices and scanning apps
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Protecting API endpoints and preventing unauthorized access to user data
- **Performance at Scale**: Database and API performance with increasing user base
- **Media Asset Management**: Storage and bandwidth considerations for profile photos and company logos
- **iOS App Store Approval**: Meeting Apple's guidelines for business card applications
- **Open Source Maintenance**: Long-term sustainability and community contribution management

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Backend API foundation with user authentication and basic business card CRUD operations
- **Milestone 2**: iOS app with core business card creation and QR code generation functionality
- **Milestone 3**: Web application with enhanced business card management features
- **Milestone 4**: Cross-platform synchronization implementation and testing
- **Milestone 5**: Security hardening and API credential protection
- **Milestone 6**: Media asset management and optimization
- **Milestone 7**: Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- **Milestone 8**: Documentation completion and open-source release preparation

## Environment Setup
- **PHP Development Environment**: Install PHP 8.1+, Apache 2.4+, and MySQL 8+
- **iOS Development**: Xcode with iOS 15+ target, Swift 5.9+ support
- **Database Setup**: Create MySQL database with appropriate user permissions and initial schema
- **Web Server Configuration**: Configure Apache virtual hosts and PHP settings
- **Email Service**: Set up Google Gmail API credentials and configuration for verification code delivery
- **QR Code Libraries**: Install PHP QR code generation library and iOS QR code scanning framework
- **File Permissions**: Configure proper file system permissions for media asset storage
- **API Testing Environment**: Set up Postman or similar tool for endpoint testing
- **Version Control**: Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore files
