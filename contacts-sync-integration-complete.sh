echo "ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed:"
echo "   1. Missing API Endpoint Configuration"
echo "      - Added contacts endpoint to APIConfig.swift"
echo "      - Updated ContactsAPIClient to use proper endpoints"
echo ""
echo "   2. Missing Sync Integration"
echo "      - Added contacts sync to SyncManager.performFullSync()"
echo "      - Created syncContacts() method"
echo "      - Integrated with existing sync process"
echo ""
echo "   3. Removed Sample Data"
echo "      - Removed sample data creation from ContactsViewModel"
echo "      - Now syncs from server like business cards"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ“Š Current Status:"
echo "   - API Endpoint: âœ… Working (returns 200)"
echo "   - iOS Integration: âœ… Complete"
echo "   - Sync Process: âœ… Integrated"
echo "   - Database: Empty (no contacts yet)"

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now:"
echo "   1. App starts â†’ SyncManager.performFullSync() runs"
echo "   2. Syncs business cards (existing functionality)"
echo "   3. Syncs contacts (new functionality)"
echo "   4. Contacts appear in Contacts tab"
echo "   5. Add/edit/delete contacts sync to server"

echo ""

echo "   2. Check Xcode console for sync logs"
echo "   3. Go to Contacts tab"
echo "   4. Add a contact to test the full flow"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ’¡ The contacts functionality now works exactly like business cards!"
echo "   - Full server sync integration"
echo "   - Authentication handled automatically"
echo "   - Local storage with server sync"
