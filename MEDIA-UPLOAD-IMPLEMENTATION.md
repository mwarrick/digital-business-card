# Media Upload Implementation Summary

**Implemented:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

## Overview

Full media upload/download/delete functionality has been implemented for the iOS app, allowing users to upload profile photos, company logos, and cover graphics to the ShareMyCard server.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **MediaService.swift** - API Client
- ✅ Image upload with compression (0.8 quality JPEG)
- ✅ Image download from server
- ✅ Image deletion from server
- ✅ Progress indicators during operations
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ JWT authentication for all requests

### 2. **Enhanced ImagePicker.swift**
- ✅ Auto-upload on image selection
- ✅ Auto-download on view load (if server path exists)
- ✅ Server delete on image removal
- ✅ Upload progress indicator
- ✅ Success/error status display
- ✅ "Synced to server" badge when uploaded
- ✅ Support for all three image types:
  - Profile Photo
  - Company Logo
  - Cover Graphic

### 3. **Data Model Updates**
- ✅ Added `profilePhotoPath`, `companyLogoPath`, `coverGraphicPath` to BusinessCard
- ✅ Added corresponding fields to BusinessCardEntity (Core Data)
- ✅ Added fields to BusinessCardAPI model
- ✅ Updated DataManager to persist server paths
- ✅ Updated SyncManager to sync media paths

### 4. **UI Integration**
- ✅ Updated BusinessCardCreationView with image upload
- ✅ Updated BusinessCardEditView with image upload
- ✅ Server path binding for all image fields
- ✅ Automatic save of server paths when creating/editing cards

### 5. **Server Synchronization**
- ✅ Media paths synced to server on card create/update
- ✅ Media paths pulled from server during sync
- ✅ Automatic download of images from server if missing locally

## How It Works

### Upload Flow
1. User selects image from Photo Library or Camera
2. Image is automatically compressed to JPEG (80% quality)
3. Image uploads to server via multipart/form-data
4. Server returns filename and URL
5. Filename is stored in `profilePhotoPath` / `companyLogoPath` / `coverGraphicPath`
6. Path is synced to server when card is saved
7. "Synced to server" checkmark displayed

### Download Flow
1. When viewing a card, if it has a server path but no local image
2. Image is automatically downloaded from server
3. Downloaded image is displayed
4. Image data is stored locally for offline access

### Delete Flow
1. User taps "Remove Image"
2. If image exists on server (has a server path)
3. DELETE request sent to `/api/media/delete`
4. Local image and server path cleared
5. Update synced to server on next save

## API Endpoints Used

```
POST   /api/media/upload   - Upload image (multipart/form-data)
GET    /api/media/view     - Download image
DELETE /api/media/delete   - Delete image
```

## File Modifications

### New Files
- `QRCard/MediaService.swift`

### Modified Files
- `QRCard/ImagePicker.swift`
- `QRCard/BusinessCard.swift`
- `QRCard/CoreDataEntities.swift`
- `QRCard/DataManager.swift`
- `QRCard/BusinessCardCreationView.swift`
- `QRCard/BusinessCardEditView.swift`
- `QRCard/CardService.swift`
- `QRCard/SyncManager.swift`
- `QRCard/APIConfig.swift`

## Testing Checklist

### Profile Photo
- [ ] Upload via Photo Library
- [ ] Upload via Camera
- [ ] View uploaded image
- [ ] Delete uploaded image
- [ ] Sync to server
- [ ] Download from server

### Company Logo
- [ ] Upload via Photo Library
- [ ] Upload via Camera
- [ ] View uploaded image
- [ ] Delete uploaded image
- [ ] Sync to server
- [ ] Download from server

### Cover Graphic
- [ ] Upload via Photo Library
- [ ] Upload via Camera
- [ ] View uploaded image
- [ ] Delete uploaded image
- [ ] Sync to server
- [ ] Download from server

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Offline upload (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Large image (should compress)
- [ ] Poor network (should timeout after 60s)
- [ ] Image download failure
- [ ] Sync with missing server image

## Known Limitations

1. **Image Cropping:** Not implemented in this phase
   - Images are compressed but not cropped
   - Users cannot adjust framing
   - Recommendation: Implement in v1.3.0

2. **Image Caching:** Basic implementation
   - Images downloaded on demand
   - Stored in Core Data as binary
   - No separate image cache layer
   - May want to add disk cache in future

3. **Progress Indicators:** Basic implementation
   - Shows "Uploading..." spinner
   - No percentage progress bar
   - Sufficient for current image sizes

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 - Image Cropping (v1.3.0)
- Add TOCropViewController or similar
- Allow users to crop/adjust images before upload
- Estimated: 4-5 hours

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- Batch upload for multiple images
- Image compression settings
- Image filters/effects
- Estimated: 8-10 hours

## Technical Notes

### Image Compression
- All images compressed to JPEG at 80% quality
- Reduces upload bandwidth and server storage
- Balance between quality and file size

### Security
- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Server validates file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)
- File size limits enforced server-side
- Filenames are sanitized

### Storage
- Server stores files in `/storage/media/`
- Filenames include timestamp for uniqueness
- Files are served via `/api/media/view?filename=...`

### Error Handling
- Network errors display user-friendly messages
- Upload failures allow retry
- Graceful degradation if server unavailable
- Offline mode shows existing local images

## Build Status

✅ **No Linter Errors**  
✅ **All Components Integrated**  
✅ **Ready for Testing**

**Next:** Test all three image types in the iOS app simulator/device
