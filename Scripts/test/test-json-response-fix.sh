echo "🔧 TESTING JSON RESPONSE FORMAT FIX"
echo "==================================="

echo ""
echo "✅ Problem Identified:"
echo "   - iOS app expected 'message' field in APIResponse"
echo "   - Contacts API was missing 'message' field"
echo "   - Caused JSON decoding error: keyNotFound 'message'"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Fix Applied:"
echo "   - Added 'message' field to contacts API response"
echo "   - Now matches expected APIResponse struct format"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Testing API Response Format:"

# Test the contacts API
echo "1. Contacts API Response:"
response=$(curl -s "https://sharemycard.app/api/contacts/" -H "Authorization: Bearer test")
echo "   Response: $response"

# Check if response has all required fields
if [[ $response == *"success"* ]] && [[ $response == *"message"* ]] && [[ $response == *"data"* ]]; then
    echo "   ✅ Response format: Correct (has success, message, data)"
else
    echo "   ❌ Response format: Missing required fields"
fi

echo ""
echo "📊 Expected iOS App Behavior:"
echo "   - No more 'keyNotFound message' errors"
echo "   - Contacts should sync successfully"
echo "   - JSON decoding should work properly"
echo "   - App should display contacts (even if empty)"

echo ""
echo "🎯 API Response Structure:"
echo "   - success: true/false"
echo "   - message: 'Contacts retrieved successfully'"
echo "   - data: [] (array of contacts)"
echo "   - count: 0 (number of contacts)"

echo ""
echo "💡 This fix resolves the JSON decoding mismatch between:"
echo "   - Server API response format"
echo "   - iOS app APIResponse struct expectations"

echo ""
echo "🚀 The iOS app should now work without JSON decoding errors!"
