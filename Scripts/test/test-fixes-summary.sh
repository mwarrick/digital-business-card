echo "      - Updated ContactEntity to use String ID type"
echo "      - Updated DataManager to handle String IDs"
echo "      - Fixed 'typeMismatch Int/String' JSON decoding error"

echo "      - Added debug logging to contacts API"

echo "📊 Expected iOS App Behavior:"
echo "   - No more business cards created on rebuild"
echo "   - No more 'typeMismatch Int/String' errors"
echo "   - Contacts should sync (if server has data)"
echo "   - App should work without crashes"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Next Steps:"
echo "   1. Test the iOS app rebuild - should not create business cards"
echo "   2. Check Xcode console - should not see ID type errors"
echo "   3. Check server logs - should show contact data structure"
echo "   4. Verify contacts sync works (if server has data)"

echo ""
echo "💡 If contacts still don't sync:"
echo "   - Check server logs for contact data structure"
echo "   - Verify authentication is working"
echo "   - Check if contacts are in the correct table"

echo "🎯 The main issues should now be resolved!"
